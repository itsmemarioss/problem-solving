## Problem Solving

Project with code submitted to websites [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br) and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) and others.

### Packages

* src.main.java.br.com.itsmemario.urionlinejudge
* src.main.java.br.com.itsmemario.hackerrank

### How to run 
If you need you can pass a file with test cases

```sh
$ java strings.RevisaoDeContrato < in
```

Some hackerrank problems use an environment variable `OUTPUT_PATH` to write the output. In these cases chagen the code or define a variable with the same name.
```java
System.getenv("OUTPUT_PATH")
```

### How to submit

Before submit the class you *must* remove the package statement and rename the class to `Main`
